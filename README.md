# jquery_tictactoe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game written in Javacsript. It's an introduction to Javascript for Bitmaker's Web Development Bootcamp. I wanted to be able to create a board of any size and to have the ability to scale the game logic to whatever size I wanted. I ended up developing an algorithm to check and see if the board it set to a winning configuration for either player after a minimum number of turns.

Written entirely in Javascript, with jQuery to render the board and the moves. No set-up required, just clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.
